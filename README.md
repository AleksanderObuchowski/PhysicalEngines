# PhysicalEngines
The repository for now contains my projects in Processing language based on [NATURE OF CODE by Daniel Shiffman](http://natureofcode.com/)

Later on I'm planning to add my own physical engine containing editor where ones can on their own create costum environment like water or  wind as well as add many objects to play with.

###### All the files in NATURE OF CODE folder are .pde and you can open them with Processing editor.
