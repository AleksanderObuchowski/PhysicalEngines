This sketch simulates the universe in it's early stages, based on photo the photo showing density of mass.
The darker the picture is the more mass is in that area.
My program creates 2500 particles and sets it's mass according to brigntness of the pixel below it.
You can see that the particles then form sturtuctures looking like galaxies.

Due to the fact that particles are much closer than in real life gravity must have been limited to 30pixels.

GUI is made with interfascia library.

Special thanks to MinutePhysics for their video that acted as inspiration to this program : https://youtu.be/pQiKBM9rDoM
